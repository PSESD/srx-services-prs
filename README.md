The Privacy Rules Service (PRS), when integrated with other system components, ensures that only designated and secured data will be sent to authorized entities outside a school district. In conjunction with the EARS (External Authorized Retrieval Service), this is achieved by either requesting appropriate data on behalf of an authorized entity (only requesting data that the individual can see) or by requesting and receiving data on behalf of an authorized entity and then filtering that data that is forwarded to the caller (receiving all data and then stripping out the portions that the caller is not allowed to view). The PRS data store houses information about authorized entities, the students, and types of data that those authorized entities are allowed to view, and the API endpoints described below are used to interact with this data.
